### SCOPE OF LESSON

 %%Example of a lesson scope. (TP 350-70-14, Par 3-9) %%
 
This 2-hour lesson is an introductory level orientation to Commissary anti-robbery procedures. The **end state** of this lesson **is for new Commissary employees to be able to recall the necessary steps to take in the event of a robbery at the store. The** author's intent **is that new employees learn anti-robbery principles and procedures and choose appropriate actions during a series of scenario-based exercises. By the end of the lesson, new employees should have a solid grasp of the actions to take if the store is being robbed. This lesson is common to all Commissary departments and** links to other parts of the curriculum** by reinforcing the character attributes of accountability and responsibility.

## SECTION 1: **ADMINISTRATIVE DATA** 
## Instructional Guidance
Conduct of Lesson |**NOTE:** Before presenting this lesson, instructors must thoroughly prepare by studying this lesson and identifying reference material.
Watch the robbery video until it bores you. This is important because, during the Concrete Experience, you should be observing the students.
Before the lesson, set up one easel in each corner of the classroom. Place a marker set with each easel, and affix one scenario sheet (face down) to each easel.
Before class, play the video completely through one time. This will reduce computer lag. 

### **1. The importance of this lesson: (Why)**

Insert how this ties to the student's goals and mission, or how it makes their current operations easier, or more effective.

### **2. What we want our students to Achieve: (Outcomes/Standard)**

Choose anti-robbery measures that are appropriate to the scenario based on your interpretation of both the scenario itself and the job aid. Choices must align with the anti-robbery principles taught in the lesson.

## SECTION 2: LESSON INTRODUCTION

%%The concrete experience is supposed to be an exercise where students can tinker and fail safely and in a controlled manner. The CE allows students to stumble a little and to appreciate the lesson later even more%%

## **Concrete Experience / Motivator:** 
NOTE: Tell an interesting anecdote based on your experience, or
recall a recent current event pertaining to the lesson unit topic to
gain the student's attention and motivate them to learn the lesson
material. The student should be made aware of the Army's Contemporary
Operational Environment factors such as the physical environment,
military capabilities, technology, and information.
