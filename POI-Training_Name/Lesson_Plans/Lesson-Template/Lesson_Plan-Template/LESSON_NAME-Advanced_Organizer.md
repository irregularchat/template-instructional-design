_Publish and Process (P&P) SC, Instructor Managed (facilitated)_
1. _Ask students “what was difficult about remembering their password.”_
2. _Introduce the learning objectives_
**(**NOTE: Instruction will transition to the GNI phase based on something that is said in P&P. For example: “That's a great point and ties in well with our focus today,”…followed by introducing the learning objective where you tell participants what they will be able to do when you finish.) Introduce the Lesson Objective at GNI. |
